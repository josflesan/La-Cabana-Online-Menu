Nathan N|7 August 2019|Best Restaurant in Puerto Rico Gran Canaria|We recently stayed in Puerto Rico Gran Canaria and tried a few restaurants. But La Cabana was by far the best. The staff were amazing, the service was excellent and the food was fabulous. Very reasonably priced and we will definitely eat there next time we stay. We ate there every day it was so good.|img/reviews/nathan.jpg

Carole S|11 July 2017|Top meal at great prices|We were asked by the lady outside every time we went passed to take a look so after about a week we decided to give it a try and how glad we were. The food was absolutely spot on and plentiful. Great selection of vegetables came with main course. Price was very good compared with surrounding restaurants. Definitely worth a visit. In fact we went back the following morning for full English on way to beach around 10:30 and it again was spot on.|img/reviews/carole.jpg
